But then again sometimes I get really sweet
So what does it mean if I tell you to go fuck yourself
Or if I say that you're beautiful to me
It's affection always,

You're gonna see it someday
My attention for you
Even if it's not what you need

Sometimes we talk all night long, we don't shut up
And when it's late we'll say we're still wide awake so...
We love to talk about how you'll come up to visit me
And we'll rent a car and we'll drive upstate

It's affection always,
You're gonna see it someday
My attention's on you
Even if it's not what you need

I think of you,
I want you too,
I'd fall for you
I think of you,
I want you too,
I'd fall for you
I think of you,
I want you too,
I'd fall for you
I think of you,
I want you too,
I'd fall for you

Filming helicopters crashing
In the ocean from way above

Tell me why
Got the music in you, baby

You've been locked in here forever
And you just can't say goodbye

Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers
Wrapped in your arms

You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos
Left in the dark

Got the music in you, baby
Tell me why
Got the music in you, baby
Tell me why
You've been locked in here forever
And you just can't say goodbye

Your lips, my lips
Apocalypse

Your lips, my lips
Apocalypse

Go and sneak us through the rivers
Flood is rising up on your knees
Oh, please
Come out and haunt me
I know you want me
Come out and haunt me

Sharing all your secrets with each other
Since you were kids

Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you
Clutched in your fist

Got the music in you, baby
Tell me why

Tell me why
You've been locked in here forever

Wanted it sweet, so pure and warm

It was the first thing we did

And when you say you want it all, I know you want it all
Baby, take it all from me
And when you drag me on the floor and the blue tejano's on
You keep your eyes on me

So get in the waves, swim in your leather
I always will make it feel like you were the last one
So get in the waves like it was the first time
Bless your heart, make you part of my life forever

In shorts so high waist
The girl in the arcade said they were the shortest ever
And the rest like "Holiday"
The live one where she sang, dancin' in a polka dot top

And when you say you want it all, I know you want it all
Baby, take it all from me
And when you drag me on the floor and the blue tejano's on

There in the opera house with no one else for miles

Way in the back
Where I sit alone

Beneath the light
Of a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

I think of two young lovers
Running wild and free
I close my eyes
And sometimes see
You in the shadows
Of this smoke-filled room

No telling how many tears
I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies
That I've lied
Telling my poor heart
You will come back one day

I spend most every night
Beneath the light
Of a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams

      lyrics: ''' Staring at your Kate Moss shower curtain
Lying on the bathroom floor naked
Hiding coke inside all your orange pixie sticks
You take a rail & spread it on your tit

You‚Äôve had a long list of lovers,
But none of them matter to you except me
I‚Äôve had a long list of lovers,
But none of them matter to me except you

Sesame syrup,
I heard it a long time ago

There‚Äôs a small black notebook
That you keep hidden underneath your bed I‚Äôve seen before
It says every dirty thing that you did with every single boy
You‚Äôve ever been with‚Ä¶

& we fall asleep to the scent of long stemmed roses
Always dreaming of sex on the ceiling
& we sleep to the scent of long stemmed roses
Always dreaming of sex on the ceiling...''',

I‚Äôm just a hurricane eye,
They‚Äôre not a little too shy,

Know how they wanted to sing

Don‚Äôt you understand?
Don‚Äôt you know
The love that you want‚Äôs all the love that you needed?
Gave me all you had,
Gave me all the love that you want,
All the love that you needed

Baby blue movie with always for tuesdays

Don‚Äôt you understand?
Don‚Äôt you know
The love that you want‚Äôs gonna make it feel sweeter?
Gave me all you had,
Gave me all the love that you want,
All the love that you needed ''',

& every word you sang was about you & me

I loved everything you wrote
& when you would sing I felt that my heart was falling

You‚Äôre all I want
We fucked so hot it left me faded
For all you are
There is no other love, it‚Äôs only yours
You‚Äôre all I want, all I love

& with Cristal & pink champagne,
On our wedding day you had a Hollywood sign made of cocaine for us

Then you got on top of it & you sang to me as the snow was falling‚Ä¶ ''',

You give your love to me this way
Saying you'd wait‚ÄÖfor‚ÄÖme to stay
I‚ÄÖknow it hurts you

But I need‚ÄÖto tell you something
My heart just can't be faithful for long
I swear I'll only make you cry

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'd change for you someday
But I can't help the way I feel
Wish I was good
Wish that I could give you my love now

[Chorus]
But I need to tell you something
My heart just can't be faithful for long
I swear I'll only make you cry

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I need to tell you something
My heart just can't be faithful for long
I swear I'll only make you cry ''',
